4/19/2020 19:37:00	Benjamin Rodriguez		2A6	2021		Simon	Dallas, Tx	A friend would describe me as always laughing/happy, easy to approach, and always ready for a 1v1. Wether that be on FIFA, basketball, ping pong, soccer, volleyball or pool, I am always ready to pull the "Play me 1v1" card.	Ricky and I got into a debate with a woman at a shopping mall in Cambridge. She was heated and I kept mocking her because she was mad I was singing in Spanish. Hilarious because she would say "you can't sing, who said you can sing" and I kept saying she did. The cops came and we were dying of laughter.	https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1MdgGP2x9hEQwd019-LpYZs-yC9MirrDy		FALSE
