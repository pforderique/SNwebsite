    "bio": "Luis is a huge ambivert. He loves to hang out and connect with people on a personal level, but you can also catch him just relaxing and doing his own thing. Whether it’s going to the Havana Club with some bros to dance salsa, bachata, and/or merengue, or playing video games, or singing karaoke on a Saturday night, you can count on Luis to have a great time! He’s also obsessed with Chipotle and SpongeBob memes. Around MIT, he is a co-founder of ColorStack@MIT and one of the Exec members of the Minority Business Association, (check them out if you're into CS or business!)",
